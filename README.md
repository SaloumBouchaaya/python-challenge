# Module 3 Challenge

# In this challenge we will analyize two seperate sets of data. 

# For the each set of data there will be:

# A "Resource" folder containg the path to the data we will be working with. 
# An "Analysis" folder containing a text file to the results of our data anaysis 
# A "main.py" python file containg the code we used to create our analysis resuts. 

# For our first set of data, (PyBank) I created a financial analysis that will tell us the amount of time in our dataset, the net total, chnages in profit/loss, average of those changes, greatest increase, & greatest decrease in profits.

# With the second set of data, (PyPoll), I pulled election results: total votes, list of candidates, percentage of votes & number of votes per candidate, and the final winner based on popular vote.

# Data information was provided by edX bootcamp U.C. Berkely data analytics course.
